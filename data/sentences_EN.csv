 
The United States of America (U.S.A
"or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S"
"or US) or informally as America, is a country primarily located in North America consisting of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine Minor Outlying Islands,[i] and 326 Indian reservations"
"It is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world"
"The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City"
""
Indigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years
"Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States"
Their quarrel with the British Crown over taxation and political representation led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War
"The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy"
"The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848"
"Sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865)"
"With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally"
"By 1900, the United States established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy"
"After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S"
entered World War II on the Allied side
The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War
"During the Cold War, both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance but avoided direct military conflict"
"They also competed in the Space Race, which culminated in the 1969 landing of Apollo 11, making the U.S"
the first and only nation to land humans on the Moon
"With the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent end of the Cold War in 1991, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower"
""
The United States government is a federal republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches of government
"It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state"
"Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction"
The U.S
"ranks highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption"
"It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other developed nations, and is the only developed nation without universal healthcare"
"As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S"
has been shaped by the world's largest immigrant population
""
The United States is a highly developed country that has the highest median income of any polity in the world
Its economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by GDP at market exchange rates
"It is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter, and possesses the largest amount of wealth of any country"
"The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, NATO, World Health Organization, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council"
"It wields considerable global influence as the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power"

"The first documentary evidence of the phrase ""United States of America"" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp"
"Moylan expressed his desire to go ""with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain"" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[26][27][28] The first known publication of the phrase ""United States of America"" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[29] "
"By June 1776, the name ""United States of America"" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[30][31] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[30] "
"The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia, crossing the Bering land bridge and arriving in the present-day United States at least 12000 years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[32][33][34] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11000BC, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement in the Americas.[35][36] This was likely the first of three major waves of migration into North America; later waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans, Aleuts, and Eskimos.[37] "
"Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[38] The city-state of Cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in present-day United States.[39] In the Four Corners region in present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[40] The Algonquian, including peoples who speak Algonquian languages, were one of the most populous and widespread North American indigenous peoples.[41] These people were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions"
"Before European immigrants made contact with the Algonquian, most of the Algonquian survived by hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the ""Three Sisters"""
"The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[42] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[43] "
Estimating the native population of North America following the arrival of European immigrants is difficult.[44][45] Douglas H
"Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution estimated a population of 93000 in the South Atlantic states and a population of 473000 in the Gulf states,[46] but most academics regard this figure as too low.[44] Anthropologist Henry F"
"Dobyns believed the populations were much higher, suggesting that approximately 1.1 million resided on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, 2.2 million people living between Florida and Massachusetts, 5.2 million in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries, and around 700000 in the Florida peninsula.[44][45] "
"The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in the present-day New York Bay region.[47] The Spanish Empire set up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in Saint Augustine, which is often considered the nation's oldest city,[48] and Santa Fe"
"The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New Orleans and Mobile.[49] "
"British colonization of the east coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607, where Pilgrims settled in Jamestown and later established Plymouth Colony in 1620.[50][51] "
"The continent's first elected legislative assembly, the House of Burgesses in Virginia, was founded in 1619"
"In 1636, Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts Bay Colony was founded as the first institution of higher education"
The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[52][53] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England seeking religious freedom
"The native population of America declined after European arrival,[54][55][56] primarily as a result of infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles.[57][58] By the mid-1670s, the British defeated and seized the territory of Dutch settlers in New Netherland, in the mid-Atlantic region"
""
"In the 17th century, during European colonization, many European settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, including in King Philip's War"
"In addition to fighting European settlers, Native Americans also often fought neighboring tribes"
"But in many cases, the natives and settlers came to develop a mutual dependency"
"Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, and Native Americans traded for guns, tools, and other European goods.[59] Native Americans taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs"
"European missionaries and others felt it was important to civilize the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles.[60][61] With the increased European colonization of North America, however, Native Americans were often displaced or killed during conflicts.[62] "
"European settlers also began trafficking African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.[63] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the American South.[64] Colonial society was divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and several colonies passed acts for or against it.[65][66] "
"In what was then considered British America, the Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered as overseas dependencies by the British.[67] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some areas, Catholics.[68][69] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[70] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s, known as the Great Awakening, fueled colonial interest in both religion and religious liberty.[71] Excluding the Native Americans population, the Thirteen Colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, representing a population that was then roughly a third the size of Britain"
"By the 1770s, despite continuing new immigrant arrivals from Britain and other European regions, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[72] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed for the development of self-governance in the colonies, but it encountered periodic efforts by British monarchs to reassert royal authority.[73] "
"In 1774, the First Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colony-wide boycott of British goods"
"The American Revolutionary War began the following year, on April 19, 1775, at the Battles of Lexington and Concord"
"The colonies responded by again convening in Philadelphia in the Second Continental Congress, where, in June 1775, they appointed George Washington as commander of the Continental Army, which was initially comprised of various American patriot militias resisting the British Army"
"In June 1776, the Second Continental Congress charged a committee of five of its delegates−John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Robert R"
"Livingston, and Roger Sherman−with writing a draft of the Declaration of Independence"
"The five delegates, in turn, asked Jefferson to author its first draft"
"While Jefferson consulted with the other four delegates, he largely authored its first draft in isolation over a period of two weeks from the second floor he was renting in a home on Market Street in Center City Philadelphia.[74] "
"On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted and issued the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" The unanimous adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.[75] In 1777, the American victory at the Battle of Saratoga resulted in the capture of a British army, and led to France and their ally Spain joining in the war against them"
"After the surrender of a second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty"
"American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day Canada in the north and Florida in the south.[76] Tensions with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[77] "
"In 1781, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[75] As it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was authored and ratified in state conventions in 1788"
The U.S
"Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[78] Going into force in 1789, it reorganized the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances"
"George Washington, who led the Continental Army to victory in the Revolutionary War and then willingly relinquished power, was elected the new nation's first President under the new constitution"
"The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[79] "
"During the British Colonial era, slavery was legal in the American colonies, a longstanding institution in world history, and ""challenges to its moral legitimacy were rare"""
"However, during the Revolution, many in the colonies began to question the practice.[80] "
Regional divisions over slavery grew in the ensuing decades
"In the North, several prominent Founding Fathers such as John Adams, Roger Sherman, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and Benjamin Franklin advocated for the abolition of slavery, and by the 1810s every state in the region had, with these emancipations being the first in the Atlantic World.[81] The Missouri Compromise (1820) admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel"
"The outcome de facto sectionalized the country into two factions: free states, which forbade slavery; and slave states, which protected the institution; it was controversial, widely seen as dividing the country along sectarian lines.[82] In the South, the invention of the cotton gin spurred entrenchment of slavery, with regional elites and intellectuals increasingly viewing the institution as a positive good instead of a necessary evil.[83] Although the federal government outlawed American participation in the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the use of slave labor.[84][85][86] The Second Great Awakening, especially in the period 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism"
"In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[87] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[88] "
"In the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand further westward, some of them with a sense of manifest destiny.[89][90] The 1803 Louisiana Purchase almost doubled the nation's area,[91] Spain ceded Florida and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819,[92] the Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845 during a period of expansionism,[90] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S"
"control of the present-day American Northwest.[93] As it expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[94][95] The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that forcibly resettled Indians"
The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River[96] and eventually conflict with Mexico.[97] Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and their confinement to Indian reservations
"Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, with the U.S"
"now spanning the continent.[89][98] The California Gold Rush of 1848–1849 spurred migration to the Pacific coast, which led to the California genocide[99] and the creation of additional western states.[100] "
"Irreconcilable sectional conflict regarding the enslavement of those of black African descent[101] was the primary cause of the American Civil War.[102] With the 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, conventions in eleven slave states, all in the Southern United States, declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the federal government, known as the Union, maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[103] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy initiated military conflict by bombarding Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston harbor in South Carolina"
""
"The American Civil War, the deadliest military conflict in American history, ensued and was fought between 1861 and 1865"
"The war resulted in the deaths of approximately 620000 soldiers from both sides and upwards of 50000 civilians, most of them in the South.[104] In early July 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor, following the Union Army's victory in the Battle of Gettysburg, where Union Army general George Meade halted Confederate Army general Robert E"
Lee's invasion of the North
"In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered and soon collapsed"
""
Reconstruction began in earnest following the defeat of the Confederates
"While President Lincoln attempted to foster reconciliation between the Union and former Confederacy, his assassination on April 14, 1865 drove a wedge between North and South again"
"Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans, and the so-called Reconstruction Amendments to the Constitution guaranteed the abolishment of slavery, full citizenship to Americans of African descent, and suffrage for adult Black males"
They persisted until the Compromise of 1877
"Influential Southern Whites, calling themselves ""Redeemers"", took local control of the South after the end of Reconstruction, beginning the nadir of American race relations"
"From 1890 to 1910, the Redeemers established so-called Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all Blacks and some impoverished Whites throughout the region"
"Blacks faced racial segregation nationwide, especially in the South,[105] and lived under the threat of lynching and other vigilante violence.[106] "
"National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West"
"After the end of the American Civil War in 1865, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[107] Mainland expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[108] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S"
annexed in 1898
"Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, by the Treaty of Paris (1898) following the Spanish–American War.[109] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but only one month prior to American entry into World War I though the Jones–Shafroth Act  in 1917.[110]: 60–63  American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War.[111] The U.S"
Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[112] 
"From 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented and diverse stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, 27.5 million in total"
"In all, 24.4 million (89%) came from Europe, including 2.9 million from Great Britain, 2.2 million from Ireland, 2.1 million from Scandinavia, 3.8 million from Germany, 4.1 million from Italy, 7.8 million from Russia and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe"
"Another 1.7 million came from Canada.[115] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892, through the immigration station on Ellis Island, but various ethnic groups settled in different locations"
"New York and other large cities of the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest, obtaining jobs in industry and mining"
"At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[116] "
Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists
"Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D"
"Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries"
"Banking became a major part of the economy, with J"
P
Morgan playing a notable role
"The United States also emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry in the early 20th century.[117] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, immigration, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[118][119][120] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms, including health and safety regulation of consumer goods, the rise of labor unions, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition among businesses, and improvements in worker conditions"
"The Great Migration, which began around 1910, resulted in millions of African Americans leaving the rural South for urban areas in the North.[121] "
"The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917 when it joined the war as an ""associated power"" alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers"
"In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S"
to join the League of Nations
"However, the U.S"
"Senate refused to support this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles under which the League of Nations was established.[122] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[123] "
"During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the United States.[124] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression"
"After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D"
"Roosevelt, between 1933 and 1939, introduced his New Deal economic policies, which included public works projects, financial reforms, and regulations.[125] The Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[126] "
"At first neutral during World War II, the United States began supplying war materiel to the Allies in March 1941"
"A total of $50.1 billion (equivalent to $719 billion in 2021) worth of supplies was shipped in 1941–1945, or 17% of the total war expenditures of the U.S.[127] On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to militarily join the Allies against the Axis powers, and in the following year, to intern about 120000 Japanese and Japanese Americans.[128][129] The U.S"
"pursued a ""Europe first"" defense policy,[130] with the Philippines being invaded and occupied by Japan until the country's liberation by the U.S.-led forces in 1944–1945"
"During the war, the United States was one of the ""Four Policemen""[131] who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union, and China.[132][133] The United States emerged relatively unscathed from the war, and with even greater economic and military influence.[134] "
"The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences, during which agreements were signed on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization"
"As an Allied victory was achieved in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[135] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945; the Japanese subsequently surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.[136][137] "
"After World War II, the United States launched the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe, providing $13 billion ($115 billion in 2021).[138] for reconstruction"
"This period also marked the beginning of the Cold War, with geopolitical tensions between the U.S"
"and the Soviet Union driven by ideological differences.[139] The two countries led military affairs of Europe, with the U.S"
and its NATO allies on one side and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellite states on the other
The U.S
"engaged in regime change operations against left-wing governments, conflicts like the Korean and Vietnam Wars and led the Space Race, eventually landing people on the Moon in 1969.[140][141][142][143][144][143][140] "
"Domestically, the United States experienced economic growth, urbanization, and a rapid growth of its population following World War II"

becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[148] President Lyndon B
"Johnson initiated the ""Great Society"", introducing policies to address poverty and racial inequalities"
[149]The counterculture movement[150] and the women's movement in the U.S
"brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards sexuality and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement.[151][152] "
"The United States supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War, leading to the 1973 oil crisis"
"The 1970s and early 1980s saw stagflation and President Ronald Reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[153][154][155][156] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S"
as the world's sole superpower.[157][158][159][160] 
"In the 21st century, the U.S"
"faced challenges from terrorism, with the September 11 attacks, leading to the war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[161][162] The financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the Great Recession impacted the nation's economy.[163] The presidencies of Barack Obama[164] and Donald Trump brought significant policy changes and political polarization"
The U.S
"also faced social debates on issues such as abortion access, same-sex marriage, police brutality, and immigration"
"The Capitol riot of January 6, 2021[165] and the Supreme Court's ruling on abortion rights in 2022 further fueled protests and political divisions"

"The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[174] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave.[175] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges also reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m)"
"The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[176] and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[177] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and in North America.[178] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands"
The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[179] 
"With its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types"
"To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[180] "
The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid
Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate
"The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska"
Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar
"Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[181] "
"States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[182] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country in the world.[183] "
Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S
"in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s"
"Of the ten warmest years ever recorded in the 48 contiguous states, eight occurred after 1998"
"In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[184] "
 
The U.S
"is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and more than 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[186] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, and 295 amphibians,[187] and 91000 insect species.[188] "
"There are 63 national parks, which are managed by the National Park Service, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[189] Altogether, about 28% of the country's land area is publicly owned and federally managed,[190] primarily located in the western states.[191] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching, and less than one percent of it is used for military purposes.[192][193] "
"Environmental issues in the United States include debates on oil and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[194][195] and climate change.[196][197] The U.S"

"fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' ""health disadvantage"" gap has been increasing ever since.[431] The U.S"
"also has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries,[432] and approximately one-third of the U.S"
"adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[433] According to CDC data, mortality rates among children and adolescents increased by 20% from 2019 to 2021.[434][435] Poverty was the 4th leading cause of death for 2019, according to a 2023 study published in JAMA.[436] "

"Government-funded health care coverage for the poor (Medicaid, established in 1965) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare, begun in 1966) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications"
"In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[p][441] with the law roughly halving the uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[442] Multiple studies have concluded that ACA had reduced the mortality of enrollees.[443][444][445] However, its legacy remains controversial.[446] "
"Americans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying belief in an ""American creed"" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[448][449] Individualism,[450][451] having a strong work ethic,[452] competitiveness,[453] and altruism[454][455][456] are also cited values"
