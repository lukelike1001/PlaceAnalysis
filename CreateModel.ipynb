pre lollipop you don want use vector compatibility pre lollipop you have replace all app srccompat with android src avoid getting the error which says that you have enable vector compatibility library for that that would been great you could use anything seen this article about but doesn show any example memory usage and configuration updating issue only the mechanism far noticed some people stackoverflow suggest use appcompatresources getdrawable context drawableres which most likely bypassing the delegate option and causing the same issue mentioned above people will more likely use this works one mentioning what actually doing like anyhow different than contextcompat getdrawable resid and then people will use even though might cause hell pre lollipop there still any other way fix this issue least any example see how does really break older versions and can disable app srccompat don want use fragments animator after whole year working with android still have idea what the correct way use fragments recently stumbled upon problem where supposed flip fragment another fragment with flip animation was hoping that official android documentation would help hide view but there major problem documentation using animator objects support fragments not work with animator objects how supposed use flip animation with support fragments this case can even find example rotation that doesn use animator objects some people say that nineoldandroids library should used for this can you update documentation page use updated animation frametwork instead using animator camera had work with camera1 api once never again even use some library here another surprise the library doesn have that thing that you need and then you have hassle around find way add break and back actual camera api again another case for such library that crashes older versions even minsdk fits the biggest problem here mostly creating actual camera view had adjust aspect ratio orientation cropping preview resolution and what not make somehow work along with complying lifecycle surface textureview activity fragment and camera itself after hoping works check out samsung device broken redo everything again until find out preview size not working well are there any plans for compatibility library for camera make easier use with actual lifecycle along with cameraview avoid constant struggle seeing what the actual proper way load preview this camera outdated and mostly never used content android studio still shows many old resources from gingerbread for compatibility purposes along with that compatibility and google play library contains loads resources that fills the whole list where can pick own resources without digging are there any plans simplifying least filtering resource selection avoid this logcat logcat great use until you get literally unrelated and unremoveable logs like egl emulation that doesn help lot that keep filling the logs instead the ones you wrote want filter those then have create another filter and write package name separately each time for each app cannot pick show only selected application anyhow possible put easier way exclude tags and specify automatically package name from selected application emulator quick boot emulator has been improved for while which good thing personally don want use quick boot option usually disable however the option disable quick boot literally gone some system images like oreo x86 system image but not gone oreo x86 system image this intended and possible add option choose between cold and quick boot this case geocoder this thing broken literally far noticed will fail about out 100 attempts more less even with same identical request does use google maps platform api feels like behavior from google maps api has similar failure rates api key not used are you going remove this though support native have native and support fragments you have decided deprecate fragments android support fragments work all platforms the same way more less while native ones are not nested fragments for example there feature implement something without adding sdk and instead added support library why such feature added sdk anyway and then later due incompatibilites added support library isn easier maintain such feature support library separately simplifying sdk there are loads components that require loads boilerplate make them work properly and solution for that not always obvious one example might asynctask which requires weak reference listener avoid memory leak and requires kept fragment will get destroyed activity unless stored which troubling for just starting single task that may either leak memory reference not cleared properly never reach activity configuration changed destroyed rotation that things just wrong you want stop the task don know how much androidx and ktx will help with this but hope that this will eliminate components that shouldn used anymore and that they can properly replaced with new components without loads trouble and boilerplate them setup are you going deprecate some components that shouldn any longer used and make simplified alternatives performance stability coding whenever work any app want make sure runs properly even lower end phones however when have use workarounds the nerves sometimes cannot handle this still trying create proper architecture make sure that things work and don break but always feels like something missing that something will break the architecture soon later had troubles with fragments but managed work easier with viewmodel and livedata though with sacrifice not using onsaveinstancestate which fragments still hell work with then again you have fragmentmanager that breaks lot you need manage backstack did managed use other library for but still feels like workaround still had some additional workarounds library doesn have some feature that can done with fragmentmanager when comes bad performance google own apps are literally huge size over 100 and methods about 100k 200k methods they stutter many times almost like they perform expensive operations main thread even though they should loaded separate thread and uses loads libraries some things also you look google app open source libraries list you most likely notice load libraries that are used about them what your opinion balancing performance stability and coding practice apps how far should work with boilerplate simplify code how far should optimize avoid any kind stuttering complaints old comment thread basically mess apis pic shows small part png deprecated methods get replaced with methods different name requiring higher api ending with making another wrapper use them setting foreground requires api but documentation says api listeners for software keyboard opening closing actually you can even open close keyboard without some small hack fragments are until you have use them stacks animate them smoothly and saving instance state usually there way get filename path from uri complex hopefully architecture components will help with saving state properly and make async operations easier along with room sqlite persistence don trust 3rd party libraries much when every library has different ways something ending with mess some required feature not implemented and starting all over with hack also don like most articles going hyped with some new library features and suddenly show magical tutorials showing simplest way but not realistic another problem for are outdated tutorials half them give solutions that are

few questions related development specific sections android have least years work experience with android but general feels like months instead every single year vectordrawablecompat much like android there are way too many caveats and hacks that have keep looking before manage properly build app vectordrawablecompat feels useless use when you have mess with half the project settings make work for pre lollipop you don want use vector compatibility pre lollipop you have replace all app srccompat with android src avoid getting the error which says that you have enable vector compatibility library for that that would been great you could use anything seen this article about but doesn show any example memory usage and configuration updating issue only the mechanism far noticed some people stackoverflow suggest use appcompatresources getdrawable context drawableres which most likely bypassing the delegate option and causing the same issue mentioned above people will more likely use this works one mentioning what actually doing like anyhow different than contextcompat getdrawable resid and then people will use even though might cause hell pre lollipop there still any other way fix this issue least any example see how does really break older versions and can disable app srccompat don want use fragments animator after whole year working with android still have idea what the correct way use fragments recently stumbled upon problem where supposed flip fragment another fragment with flip animation was hoping that official android documentation would help hide view but there major problem documentation using animator objects support fragments not work with animator objects how supposed use flip animation with support fragments this case can even find example rotation that doesn use animator objects some people say that nineoldandroids library should used for this can you update documentation page use updated animation frametwork instead using animator camera had work with camera1 api once never again even use some library here another surprise the library doesn have that thing that you need and then you have hassle around find way add break and back actual camera api again another case for such library that crashes older versions even minsdk fits the biggest problem here mostly creating actual camera view had adjust aspect ratio orientation cropping preview resolution and what not make somehow work along with complying lifecycle surface textureview activity fragment and camera itself after hoping works check out samsung device broken redo everything again until find out preview size not working well are there any plans for compatibility library for camera make easier use with actual lifecycle along with cameraview avoid constant struggle seeing what the actual proper way load preview this camera outdated and mostly never used content android studio still shows many old resources from gingerbread for compatibility purposes along with that compatibility and google play library contains loads resources that fills the whole list where can pick own resources without digging are there any plans simplifying least filtering resource selection avoid this logcat logcat great use until you get literally unrelated and unremoveable logs like egl emulation that doesn help lot that keep filling the logs instead the ones you wrote want filter those then have create another filter and write package name separately each time for each app cannot pick show only selected application anyhow possible put easier way exclude tags and specify automatically package name from selected application emulator quick boot emulator has been improved for while which good thing personally don want use quick boot option usually disable however the option disable quick boot literally gone some system images like oreo x86 system image but not gone oreo x86 system image this intended and possible add option choose between cold and quick boot this case geocoder this thing broken literally far noticed will fail about out 100 attempts more less even with same identical request does use google maps platform api feels like behavior from google maps api has similar failure rates api key not used are you going remove this though support native have native and support fragments you have decided deprecate fragments android support fragments work all platforms the same way more less while native ones are not nested fragments for example there feature implement something without adding sdk and instead added support library why such feature added sdk anyway and then later due incompatibilites added support library isn easier maintain such feature support library separately simplifying sdk there are loads components that require loads boilerplate make them work properly and solution for that not always obvious one example might asynctask which requires weak reference listener avoid memory leak and requires kept fragment will get destroyed activity unless stored which troubling for just starting single task that may either leak memory reference not cleared properly never reach activity configuration changed destroyed rotation that things just wrong you want stop the task don know how much androidx and ktx will help with this but hope that this will eliminate components that shouldn used anymore and that they can properly replaced with new components without loads trouble and boilerplate them setup are you going deprecate some components that shouldn any longer used and make simplified alternatives performance stability coding whenever work any app want make sure runs properly even lower end phones however when have use workarounds the nerves sometimes cannot handle this still trying create proper architecture make sure that things work and don break but always feels like something missing that something will break the architecture soon later had troubles with fragments but managed work easier with viewmodel and livedata though with sacrifice not using onsaveinstancestate which fragments still hell work with then again you have fragmentmanager that breaks lot you need manage backstack did managed use other library for but still feels like workaround still had some additional workarounds library doesn have some feature that can done with fragmentmanager when comes bad performance google own apps are literally huge size over 100 and methods about 100k 200k methods they stutter many times almost like they perform expensive operations main thread even though they should loaded separate thread and uses loads libraries some things also you look google app open source libraries list you most likely notice load libraries that are used about them what your opinion balancing performance stability and coding practice apps how far should work with boilerplate simplify code how far should optimize avoid any kind stuttering complaints old comment thread basically mess apis pic shows small part png deprecated methods get replaced with methods different name requiring higher api ending with making another wrapper use them setting foreground requires api but documentation says api listeners for software keyboard opening closing actually you can even open close keyboard without some small hack fragments are until you have use them stacks animate them smoothly and saving instance state usually there way get filename path from uri complex hopefully architecture components will help with saving state properly and make async operations easier along with room sqlite persistence don trust 3rd party libraries much when every library has different ways something ending with mess some required feature not implemented and starting all over with hack also don like most articles going hyped with some new library features and suddenly show magical tutorials showing simplest way but not realistic another problem for are outdated tutorials half them give solutions that are longer valid contain code with flaws causing memory leaks unstable functionality final note also apologize couldn express what wanted ask explain tired with working legacy projects that use deprecated
